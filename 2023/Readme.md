# Advent of Code 2023

Here are my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) challenges. Please note that the code is primarily for fun and may not adhere to best practices for clean coding.

## Setup

* Install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* Install [git](https://git-scm.com/)
* Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/mxwnk/aoc`
* Run `npm install` to install all dependencies
* Run `npm test` to start the test suite

Happy coding :)
